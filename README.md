# Vortex
Vortex is a lightweight and high-performance standard library designed for use in both Zig and C programming languages. With a focus on performance and minimalism, Vortex provides essential functionality for developing efficient applications across various platforms.

### Supported Platforms
Vortex aims to be compatible with the following platforms:
- Linux
- Mac (soon)
- Windows (soon)
- BSD (soon)

### Linux for Ultra Performance
While Vortex is designed to function optimally across multiple platforms, we recommend running it on Linux for the best performance. Linux offers a robust environment that complements Vortex's capabilities, allowing your applications to harness the full potential of this high-performance standard library.

### Projects inside the monorepo
- Vortex (A high-level cross-platform library)
- VortexRing (A low-level Linux-only library for ring buffer kernel communication)
- VortexSys (A low-level Linux-only library that contains the syscall wrappers)
- VortexAbi (A low-level C library for providing fixed-size types)

### License
Vortex is licensed under the [MIT](LICENSE) License, allowing for both personal and commercial use with minimal restrictions.
